## Introduction

Magisk Zygote64_32 is a modification of Magisk, which is a suite of software primarily designed as a root solution for multilib Android devices that are Zygote64 only.<br>
Some highlight features:

- **MagiskSU**: Provide root access for applications
- **Magisk Modules**: Modify read-only partitions by installing modules
- **MagiskBoot**: The most complete tool for unpacking and repacking Android boot images
- **Zygisk**: Run code in every Android applications' processes

Added with [Magisk Zygote64_32](https://github.com/Namelesswonder/Magisk/tree/32bit) is:

- **Zygote64_32**: Enables secondary Zygote process to allow 32-bit applications to start

Further added with [Magisk Delta 32-bit](https://github.com/Namelesswonder/Magisk/tree/delta-32bit) is:

- **early-mount.d**: Mount files before the init process is ran
- **init.rc injection**: Inject rc scripts without having to rebuild the initrd
- **Systemless file removal**: Remove file and folders systemlessly
- **SuList**: Hides Magisk binaries by default and only whitelisted processes can use Magisk
- **Maru**: Zygisk implementation using Native Bridge

Currently only the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are officially supported by this project.

Currently only Magisk Zygote64_32 has full support, with Magisk Delta 32-bit being offered _as-is_.

## Downloads

[My GitHub download repository](https://github.com/Namelesswonder/magisk-files) has the downloads of the Magisk app for both Magisk Zygote64_32 and Magisk Delta 32-bit.

**NOTE: Magisk Delta 32-bit is offered _as-is_, as I do not run it daily.**

## Bug Reports

**Only bug reports from Magisk Zygote64_32 builds will be accepted, as I am not running Magisk Delta 32-bit**

For installation issues, upload both boot image and install logs.<br>
For bootloops or Magisk issues, upload boot logcat or dmesg.<br>

## Building and Development

- Magisk builds on any OS Android Studio supports. Install Android Studio and do the initial setups.
- Clone sources: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Namelesswonder/Magisk.git`
- Switch branch to appropriate version: `git switch 32bit` or `git switch delta-32bit`
- Install Python 3.8+ \
  (Windows only: select **'Add Python to PATH'** in installer, and run `pip install colorama` after install)
- Configure to use the JDK bundled in Android Studio:
  - macOS: `export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jre/Contents/Home"`
  - Linux: `export PATH="/path/to/androidstudio/jre/bin:$PATH"`
  - Windows: Add `C:\Path\To\Android Studio\jre\bin` to environment variable `PATH`
- Set environment variable `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` to the Android SDK folder (can be found in Android Studio settings)
- Run `./build.py ndk` to let the script download and install NDK for you
- To start building, run `build.py` to see your options. \
  For each action, use `-h` to access help (e.g. `./build.py all -h`)
- To start development, open the project with Android Studio. The IDE can be used for both app (Kotlin/Java) and native sources.
- Optionally, set custom configs with `config.prop`. A sample `config.prop.sample` is provided.

## Signing and Distribution

- The certificate of the key used to sign the final Magisk APK product is also directly embedded into some executables. In release builds, Magisk's root daemon will enforce this certificate check and reject and forcefully uninstall any non-matching Magisk apps to protect users from malicious and unverified Magisk APKs.
- To do any development on Magisk itself, switch to an **official debug build and reinstall Magisk** to bypass the signature check.
- To distribute your own Magisk builds signed with your own keys, set your signing configs in `config.prop`.
- Check [Google's Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#generate-key) for more details on generating your own key.

## Translation Contributions

Default string resources for the Magisk app and its stub APK are located here:

- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- `stub/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

Translate each and place them in the respective locations (`[module]/src/main/res/values-[lang]/strings.xml`).
